arboreal, which means that they live in trees. They do not live in big
groups but rather prefer to be alone.`
const text2 = `Behavioral adaptations: - Koalas live in a community.`
const text3 = `How the animal gets food`
const text4 = `Rough pads on the palms and soles of the paws helping to grip tree
trunks and branches. - Koalas have fur on their bottoms which is like a
cushion for hard branches they sit on, it also acts as a camouflage to
make the Koala hard to spot from the ground.`
const text5 = `The koala has special teeth adapted for their eucalyptus diet. ...
Eucalyptus leaves are high in fiber and low in nutrients. In addition to
eating large amounts, koalas are able to survive on their diet since
they have a slow metabolic system to conserve nutrients and energy.`

affects humans â€“ although it seems humans can catch the koala version
through exposure to an infected animal's urine. In koalas, the effects
of chlamydia are devastating, including blindness, infertility and an
infection known as 'dirty tail'.`
